    "\n",
    "Because `jupyter-book` is built on top of {term}`Sphinx`,\n",
    "there are many ways to reference content within your book (or even across other books, or Sphinx websites). This page has several examples of what you can reference and how to accomplish it.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip}\n",
    "You can check for missing references when building a Jupyter Book.\n",
    "To do so, use the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter-book build -W -n --keep-going docs/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will check for missing references (`-n`) and turn them into errors (`-W`),\n",

    "## Referencing overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Referencing is accomplished with **roles** or with **markdown link syntax**, depending on your use-case.\n",
    "There are a few ways to reference content from your book, depending on what kind of content you'd like to reference.\n",
    "Here is a quick overview of some common roles for referencing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `{ref}` is used to reference section labels that you define or figures with a `name` value\n",
    "* `{numref}` is used to provide *numbered* references to figures, tables, or headers\n",
    "* `{doc}` is used to reference other files in your book\n",
    "* `{eq}` is used to reference equations that have been given a `label` value\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition,tip} Choosing your own link text\n",
    "You can reference a section label through ``{ref}`label` `` or ``{ref}`some text <label>` ``.\n",
    "Documents can be referenced through ``{doc}`path/to/document` `` or ``{doc}`some text <path/to/document>` ``\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numbered references\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a **numbered reference** to a table, use the `{numref}` role. If you wish to use custom text, add `%s` as a placeholder for the number.\n",
    "See the examples in each section below for usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Referencing with markdown link syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to use Markdown style syntax, then MyST Markdown will try to find a reference,\n",
    "from any of the above reference types (and more!).\n",
    "This has an advantage, in that you can used nested markdown syntax in your text, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "[A **bolded _reference_** to a page](./myst.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "[A reference to a header](content:references)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "produces\n",
    "\n",
    "[A **bolded _reference_** to a page](./myst.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "[A reference to a header](content:references)\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaving the title empty will mean the reference uses the target as text, for example the syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "[](./myst.md)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will link to a section and use its header text as the link text itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "[](./myst.md)\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition,tip} Internval vs. External URLs\n",
    "You can control how MyST Markdown distinguishes between internal references and external URLs in your `_config.yml`.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "parse:\n",
    "   myst_url_schemes: [mailto, http, https]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "means that `[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org)` will be recognised as a URL, but `[Citations](content:citations)` will not:\n",

    "## Reference section labels\n",
    "\n",
    "Labels are a way to add tags to parts of your content so that you can reference them\n",
    "later on. This is helpful if you want to quickly insert links to other\n",
    "parts of your book. Labels can be added before major elements of a page,\n",
    "such as titles or figures.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Cross-references and labels\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "- `` {ref}`label-text` ``\n",
    "- `[](label-text)`\n",

    "   ,\tpublisher\t= {AIP Publishing}\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add a citation**. In your content, use the following syntax to include a citation:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```md\n",
    "   {cite}`mybibtexcitation`\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example,\n",

    "   {cite}`perez2011python`\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   generates this citation: {cite}`perez2011python`\n",

    "You can also optionally customize the style of your references.\n",
    "By default, references are displayed in the `alpha` style.\n",
    "Other currently supported styles include `plain`, `unsrt`, and `unsrtalpha`.\n",
    "These styles create the following bibliography formatting:\n",

    "* `alpha`: Use alphanumeric reference labels, citations are sorted by author, year.\n",
    "* `plain`: Use numeric reference labels, citations are sorted by author, year.\n",
    "* `unsrt`: Use numeric reference labels, citations are sorted by order of appearance.\n",
    "* `unsrtalpha`: Use alphanumeric reference labels, citations are sorted by order of appearance.\n",

    "You may wish to include a bibliography listing at the end of each document\n",
    "rather than having a single bibliography contained in a separate document.\n",
    "Having multiple bibliography directives, however, can cause `sphinx` to issue\n",
    "`duplicate citation warnings`.\n",
